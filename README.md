# Portfolio
My first portfolio site, working bit by bit... haha get it?
I'm early in the learning stages of a developer so this will be a modest site for a while, however it will improve as my skills grow! I aim to become a MEAN stack developer so I have a long road ahead, going to stay motivated and put in work!
