        <p>Hello! My name is Jerel Williams, I am from Long Island, NY, and I am an aspiring web developer. I became interested in coding in April 2017 after my friend, who is a senior software engineer, showed me what it is about after I asked out of curiosity. I decided to try it out and went through a tutorial on Codacademy and instantly fell in love with coding. The fact that I can create almost anything I want and solve problems through coding is what got me hooked. I'd love to help create the next big app that hits the market and to collaborate with a good team in order to meet that goal. I did not go to college for computer science or anything related to technology (I graduated undergrad under an Exercise Science major), but I am currently self-teaching the skills that I need to master and I am eager to improve.</p>
